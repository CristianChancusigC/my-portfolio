## ü§î Challenges

As this was my first time building a web page with React, I faced several challenges, including:

- Implementing and deploying the portfolio on GitHub Pages.
- Creating a dark/light mode toggle.
- Adding a multi-language system.
- Working with animations and making the site interactive.
